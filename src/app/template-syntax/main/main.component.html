<!-- 
**Attribute directives** are a type of directive that allows you to change the appearance or behavior of a DOM element. 
They are called "attribute directives" because you apply them to HTML elements as attributes. 
These directives manipulate the behavior, appearance, or structure of the DOM element they are attached to.

Angular provides several built-in attribute directives, such as:

- ngClass: This directive dynamically adds or removes CSS classes based on certain conditions.
- ngStyle: Allows you to dynamically set CSS styles based on expression evaluation.
- ngModel: Used mainly in forms for two-way data binding, allowing the value of an input field to be bound to a variable in the component.
- ngIf: Conditionally adds or removes the element from the DOM based on an expression.
- ngSwitch: Another way of conditionally displaying elements by switching between multiple possible views based on an expression.
- ngFor: Iterates over a collection (such as an array) and creates a template for each item.

**Property binding** allows you to set the value of an HTML element property (such as src, href, disabled, value, etc.) based on a value from the component class. 
It binds the value of a property in the component class to an attribute of an HTML element in the template. 
Property binding is denoted by square brackets [].

Here's a list of common properties that can be bound using property binding in Angular:

- src: Binds the source URL of an image or iframe element.
- href: Binds the URL of an anchor element.
- disabled: Binds the disabled state of an input, button, or other form elements.
- value: Binds the value of an input element, such as text input, checkbox, radio button, etc.
- innerHTML: Binds HTML content to be rendered inside an element.
- innerText: Binds plain text content to be rendered inside an element.
- hidden: Binds the visibility of an element.
- style: Binds inline CSS styles to an element.
- class: Binds CSS classes to an element.
- id: Binds the ID attribute of an element.
- placeholder: Binds the placeholder text of an input element.
- checked: Binds the checked state of a checkbox or radio button.
- min, max: Binds the minimum and maximum values of an input element.
- readOnly: Binds the read-only state of an input element.

**Event binding** is a way to listen to and react to events that occur in the HTML DOM.
Here are some common types of event binding in Angular:

- Click Event Binding: Used to handle click events on HTML elements like buttons, links, etc.
- Input Event Binding: Listens for changes in input elements such as text input, textarea, etc.
- Key Event Binding: Allows you to handle keyboard events such as keydown, keyup, and keypress.
- Mouse Event Binding: Used to handle mouse events such as mouseover, mouseout, mousedown, mouseup, etc.
- Form Event Binding: Helps in handling form events such as submit, reset, etc.
- Change Event Binding: Listens for changes in select elements and other form controls that support the change event.
- Focus and Blur Event Binding: Used to handle focus and blur events on HTML elements.
- Scroll Event Binding: Allows you to react to scroll events on HTML elements.

      <!-- Event binding + Property Binding + Attribute Directive -->

      <img (click)="isHighlighted = !isHighlighted" [src]="userImage" [ngClass]="{ 'spin-animation': isHighlighted }" style="cursor: pointer;" class="img-fluid mt-3 mb-3">

      <!-- Structural attribute directive -->
      <ul class="list-group mt-3">
        <li class="list-group-item" *ngFor="let item of items">{{ item }}</li>
      </ul>

      <!-- The *ngIf directive in Angular does remove the element and its contents from the DOM when the condition evaluates to false. 
      This means that if the condition provided to *ngIf is false, the element and its contents will not be rendered in the DOM at all.
      If you don't want to remove the element from the DOM but rather hide it based on a condition, you can use the [hidden] attribute binding instead of *ngIf. -->

      <div [hidden]="true" class="alert alert-success" role="alert">
        I am always hidden but never removed from the DOM.
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
